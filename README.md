# Risky
My attempt at making a RISC-V emulator in C.

<hr>

## Building
First, install the following tools:
- C Compiler with C99 Support (ex: gcc, clang)
- Make

Next:
- Clone the repository (if you haven't already).
- Just run `make`, wait and **BOOM** you're done!

## Disclosure 

This project is heavily inspired by [fmash16/riscv_emulator](https://github.com/fmash16/riscv_emulator.git).
